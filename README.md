# Queueing
Creating an program to facilitate queueing in large populations. 
TO DO: 
#1
#Generate a list/database of student information
#Including:
#First Name, Last Name, Grade, ID
# Most usefully as a Dictionary with ID as key

#Is there an easy way to turn a CSV into a dictionary?

#2
#Somehow take input of student ID (key to student dictionary)
#Options - 
#A - write it in
#B - A barcode scanner - Bluetooth would be nice
#C - Phone Camera - piggy back off an API
